### Well Rescue

In the future, sweet water disappeared from most of the Earth surface.
Thus, in the continent internals, mankind build deep wells to be able to get (harvest/extract; see other themes) enough drinking water from the deep.
Occassionally, the high pressure can cause rapid water inflow to these wells which while a fortunate event, might be fatal to the crew working in the deep.
Simple [Ugh!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugh!) like game. Water is flowing into a deep pit/well.
You should rescue men by transporting them up to higher platforms (some might have lifts and/or stairs) or to the surface.
Alternatively you can support those who are able to swim with thermal suits to win some time.
You will get a larger helicopter after some time.
