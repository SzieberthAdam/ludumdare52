A neat little puzzle game made with Raylib & C.
Your goal is to equalize the count of grass (0), grain (1), lettuce (2), berry (3) and seed (4) tiles on the map.
Tiny negative and positive signs indicate the surplus and shortage values.
By clicking on a tile, its value gets added to its neighbours.
For example clicking on a grain adds 1 to a neighbour berry which then transforms to a seed (3+1=4).

Part of the enjoyment is to figure out its mechanics yourself.
Once you do that, the game gets relatively easy to solve.
There are some tricks to find quickly the tile you should pick at the end but it requires some practice to learn them.
